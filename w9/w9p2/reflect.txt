Difficulties in ws 9:
 
- void Text::read() is hard at first because I don't understand the 
instruction.
- void HtmlText::write(std::ostream& os)const is confusing because I don't know how to use the protected index operator of the base class.


Difficulties in ms3:
- The most difficult part is std::istream& Date::read(std::istream& is ). I got unbehavior output because I didn't comment 'is.clear(); '. At first, I dont think that the problem will be in the Date.cpp file. So, I only rechecked every cpp file except Date.cpp. As a result, I spent so many hours to fix this.

-I forgot the if condition to check whether the Streamable object is valid or not in std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Streamable& stream), leading to error and couldntt print anything.

- In std::istream& Publication::read(std::istream& istr), I spent some time to understnd how to use getline properly. For example,
istr.getline(temp_shelfId, SDDS_SHELF_ID_LEN +1, '\t');, it reads the characters from input stream and store in temp_shelfId. Additionally, it will stop reading when the number of characters 'SDDS_SHELF_ID_LEN' is read or  '\t'(the delimeter) is read.

My mistake is I didn't use (SDDS_SHELF_ID_LEN) + 1. So, it had overflow.

- In bool Publication::conIO(std::ios& iosObj)const,  I didn't understand the instruction and the purpose of it. Therefore, it also took a while to implement although it isn't hard.
