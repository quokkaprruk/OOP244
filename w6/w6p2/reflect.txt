-----------------------------
The difficulties in this workshop are as follows:

- There was an error due to not initializing nullptr in 
Line* m_textLines{nullptr}; and char* m_filename{nullptr}.

- I implemented the Line(){} constructor in the .cpp file. 
However, it caused an error due to the constructor redefinition 
since the code already provides a default constructor in the 
class definition.

- The usage of c_str() was initially confusing for me, but 
now I understand that it converts a string to an array of 
characters and returns a pointer to that array.

- I spent a lot of time on the copy constructor and copy 
assignment operator because I initially tried to reuse setNoOfLines() 
and loadText() to save the content of the source file. However, 
I later realized that it was incorrect. As a result, I wrote new code 
to allocate memory and copy the source content to the current content.

NOTE: I lent Ka YING CHAN 5 functions as follows:
TextFile(const TextFile& TF)
TextFile& operator=(const TextFile& TF)
ostream& view(ostream& ostr)const
istream& getFile(istream& istr)
const char* operator[](unsignedÂ index)const
